# Sorting Visualizer

## Overview
Sorting Visualizer is a Java-based GUI application that visually demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work. It provides an interactive way to learn, observe, and compare different sorting strategies in real-time.

---

## Features
- Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms
- Understand algorithm behavior step by step
- Compare performance of multiple algorithms
- Interactive GUI – intuitive and easy to use

---

## Tech Stack
- **Java** – Primary programming language
- **Maven** – Build automation and dependency management
- **Swing/AWT** – For graphical interface
- **Any IDE** – IntelliJ, Eclipse, or your preferred text editor

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:

- Java JDK (version 8 or later)
  ```bash
  java -version
  ```
- Maven
  ```bash
  mvn -version
  ```

If not installed, download [Java JDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

---

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
cd sorting-visualizer
```
Or download the ZIP and extract it.

---

### 3. Build the Project with Maven
```bash
mvn clean install
```

---

### 4. Run the Application

#### Option A: Using Maven directly
```bash
mvn exec:java
```

#### Option B: Run the JAR manually
```bash
java -jar target/Sorting-Visualizer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
Ensure the version in the filename matches the version in your `pom.xml`.

---

## Usage
1. Launch the application
2. Select a sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort)
3. Click "Start" to begin visualizing the sorting process
4. Watch the elements as they are compared and swapped in real-time
